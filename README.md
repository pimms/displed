RGB Matrix Controller for Raspberry Pi.

Supports simulation display for development (run with -DSIMULATOR=1).


## Prerequisites

Requires https://github.com/pimms/rpi-rgb-led-matrix to be built and installed
on the host Raspberry.

Currently only supports a single 64x32 RGB Matrix, connected to the RPi via an
Adafruit HUB75 HAT.
